# Software Engineering Take-Home Exam

Welcome to your take-home exam for the Software Engineering position. This project is a simple web application with a React frontend and a C# ASP.NET backend.

Your task is to identify and fix bugs to make the application run correctly.

Feel free to use ChatGPT/GPT4 or any other AI tools at your disposal. 

Ideally it should take less than 30 minutes getting the project running and solving all the tasks.

The goal is to test you have a basic understanding of Git, C#, Node, Typescript, ReactJS (hooks and context), Dependency Injection.

## Getting Started

We're expecting you to see build errors etc. Solving them is apart of the challenge.

If there is one you cannot solve please mention it in the email and we can go over it.

It is assumed you'll have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/) (Or Bun)
  Ideally v16+

- .NET Core 8 SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

You will need to get the front-end setup and running first (UI folder), then start the backend.

Review the package.json
Don't forget to npm install or bun install.

The UI is proxied through the backend, so both will need to be running.

UI Should be accessed from http://localhost:3000/
